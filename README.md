## Program to Control Robot using Brain Signal (EEG)

This program used for EEG calibration, using SSVEP method.

Using pygame to create a visual display that flickering at frequency 10Hz and 12 Hz.

Comparing EEG signal data recorded from these 2 flickering frequencies (maybe) could increase the confidence.

Calculate EEG signal data with CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis). If the differences between signal data (in STFT format) can be easily seen, then electrode is good.

The program inspired from many sources, check for more detail in the source
